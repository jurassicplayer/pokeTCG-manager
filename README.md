# pokeTCG-manager
A PTCG deck/card manager to theorycraft decks.

Currently it does nothing.

Planned methodology:
- Methods to scrape information from the official pokemon website.
- Dump the information into a convenient sqlite db.
- Searchable query for various bits of information (by HP, Energy Cost, Type, etc.)
- Personal deck/inventory management via a user db.
- Some sort of UI that isn't bad.
